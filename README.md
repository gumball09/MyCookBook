## MYCOOKBOOK

This is a Next.js project called __MyCookBook__, which sells recipes of different food categories.\
To view the detailed recipes, the user must create an account and purchase them.
Each purchase is different and unique. Regardless of whether the user has already purchased a recipe, the new purchase will still
include the price for that recipe.
